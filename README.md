# :star: Welcome to you ! :)

I'm a 2nd year student at the CPNV and i'm actually 17 years old. I doesn't have any project yet, because i need to learn some basics, but that's okay, i'm having fun with it.  

I'm trying to get better almost everyday, one day i will create blogs or something like that, that's a good start, i think...
Anyway, i think that i will set some news about this project here, if i get motivated to do it. :(
